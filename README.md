# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose:
To look into ride sharing data depending on location (urban, rural or suburban) for a company owner and prepare a compehensive analytical work on the ride sharing data provided.

Results depending on three city types Urban, Suburban and Rural are as follows 
  - Total number of rides are 1,625
  - Average fare per ride is $24.53
  - Total number of drivers are 2,405
  - Total fare amounts to $39,854.38
  - Average fare per driver is $16.57
## Suburban

# Summary
From the data, we see that the number of drivers reduces tremendously in the rural cities versus the urban cities

Recommendations based on findingd are as follows:
- look to reduce cost per ride depending on areas
- look to increase rides to the rural areas to decrease fare price
- look to expand dataset with various other factors like demographic, etc to have a more deep dive into the data
